# Advising_Transcript_for_Students
A Java Project


In the project, I developed a system that helps a student to determine his or her progress toward meeting graduation requirements. Through the project, I managed information stored in a file, used ArrayLists and GUI Interface to display data, and used ArrayList methods to sort and categorize data. The full report displayed students's course history, summary information, distribution area fulfillment information, competency status, and courses sorted by GPA.
